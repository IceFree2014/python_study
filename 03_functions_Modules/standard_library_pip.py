# There are three main types of modules in Python,those you
# write youself, those you install from external source, and 
# those that are preinstalled with Python
# The last type is called the "standard library", and contains 
# many useful modules. Some of the standard library's usefull modules include
# "string, re, datetime, math, random, os, mutiprocessing, subprocess, socket"
# "email, json, doctest, unittest, pdb, argparse and sys"

# Python's extensive standard library is one of its main strengths as a language

# Some of the modules in the standard library are writen in Python, and 
# some are writen in C. Most are available on all platforms, but some are
# Windows or Unix specific

# Many third-party Python modules are stored on the Python Package Index(PyPI)
# The best way to install these is using a program called "pip".
# "pin install library_name"
